				"It's hard to believe that Highland Park's 18-year-old Single Malt was first "
				+ "released in 1997, as its great reputation belies its youth. On the nose you "
				+ "get honey, sherry and peat coupled with almonds and light smoke, which makes "
				+ "it not just approachable but irresistible. It is simultaneously subtle and "
				+ "complex while allowing the consumer to enjoy a smooth and dynamic expression "
				+ "of the Orkney Islands' most prized distillery. It finishes with heather and "
				+ "honey mixed with earth, dried fruit and nuts."
