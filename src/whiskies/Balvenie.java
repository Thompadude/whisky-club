				"Founded in 1892, The Balvenie is one of the pioneers of introducing various "
				+ "wood finishes to its malts. Their aptly named DoubleWood is a 12-year-old "
				+ "Single Malt that spends most of its life in second-fill Bourbon casks prior"
				+ " to being transferred to first-fill Oloroso sherry casks. There are three levels"
				+ " of flavor in this Single Malt. The original Balvenie imparts heather, honey and"
				+ " clean barley flavors. The Bourbon barrel adds vanilla, a sort of cookie-like taste,"
				+ " as well as marshmallow, caramel and toast. The Oloroso sherry barrel's influence is"
				+ " expressed via peach, marzipan, clover, a bit of honey and prunes."
