				"Springbank Distillery's 10-year-old cask-strength Single Malt is a lightly peated,"
				+ " shining example of their craftsmanship, which features a unique two-and-a"
				+ " half-times distillation process. On the nose it offers an array of aromas,"
				+ " including honey, fresh cucumber and a hint of brininess, finishing with smoke"
				+ " and peat. Although it begins its life in Bourbon barrels, it finishes out in"
				+ " sherry barrels, lending to its richness. The 100 proof is needed to support "
				+ "and balance this intense Scotch. The mouthfeel is full, luscious and a tad sweet"
				+ " with a long finish of smoke, peaty lemon zest and fall leaves."
